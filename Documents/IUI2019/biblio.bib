abstract="The amount of functionality offered by nowadays applications is constantly growing, mostly leading to more and more complex user interfaces. This often decreases their usability, especially in mobile settings where we have to deal with limited input and output capabilities. We state that adapting the interface to the available devices as well as to the user's current needs is the key to improving usability. In this paper, we present the AUGUR system that can automatically generate user- and device-adapted interfaces. We thereby focus on the FxL* algorithm that determines which user interface elements are currently relevant for a user. We show that it clearly outperforms algorithms that do not take the user or her situation into account.",

Depending on the inputs we get up to four times faster than non-clustered search. The resulting clusters are also useful for data compression and for distributing the work over many machines.",
